# Characterizing and Modeling Non-Volatile Memory Systems

This repo contains the source code for our MICRO 2020 paper [Characterizing and Modeling Non-Volatile Memory Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ziw002/files/micro20-lens-vans.pdf)

The tools are open sourced in separate GitHub repos, as they use different licenses:

1. [LENS: A Low-level NVRAM Profiler](https://github.com/TheNetAdmin/LENS)
2. [VANS: A Validated NVRAM Simulator](https://github.com/TheNetAdmin/VANS)

Technical issues should be redirected to the corresponding GitHub repos.
