# Characterizing and Modeling Non-Volatile Memory Systems

This repo contains the source code for our MICRO 2020 paper [Characterizing and Modeling Non-Volatile Memory Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ziw002/files/micro20-lens-vans.pdf)

LENS and VANS are open sourced in separate GitHub repos, as they use different licenses.
Technical issues should be redirected to the corresponding GitHub repos.

VANS code will come soon.
